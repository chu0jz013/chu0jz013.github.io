# About This Site

This portfolio is inspired by [macOS](https://www.apple.com/vn/os/macos/) and built with modern web technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the UI
- [UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me/) for styling
- Hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/chu0jz013)
- Icons are generated with [sindresorhus/file-icon-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-icon-cli).

Originally created by [Renovamen](https://portfolio.zxh.me/), this portfolio has been customized and adapted to fit my own style.
